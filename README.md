# Applied-Machine-Learning
## 1) Instance Based Methods

In this project I explored instance-based methods on two problems: handwritten digit recognition and temperature prediction. 

The aims of this were:
```
Gain experience with machine learning methods based on retrieval, particularly K-means clustering, KNN classification, and KNN regression
Get experience working with FAISS, which provides much faster search and is very useful in practice. 
Learn how feature representations can impact performance
Get practice selecting parameters using a validation set (stretch goals)
```
## 2)  PCA and Linear Models

In this project I explored linear projection, classification, and regression methods, again on digit recognition and temperature prediction.  
The aims of this were:
Become familiar with PCA, Linear Logistic Regression, SVM, and Linear Regression methods. 
Gain practice using visualizations and analysis to better understand the models and their effectiveness
Gain experience in classification and regression applications

## PDFs and Outliers

In this project I explored methods to estimate probability functions and to robustly estimate statistics in the presence of corrupted or missing data.
The aims of this were:
Be able to estimate probability functions using several methods: per-feature 1D histograms, clustering for joint histograms, and mixture of Gaussian models.
Be able to estimate statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, min, and max while being robust to data values that are incorrect or missing.
